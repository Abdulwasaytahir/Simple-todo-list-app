✅ Simple To-Do List App

A beginner-friendly Python command-line To-Do List application that helps you add, view, complete, and delete tasks — all from your terminal!
Perfect for anyone learning Python basics like loops, lists, and functions.

🚀 Features

✅ Add new tasks
✅ View all tasks with status (Done / Not Done)
✅ Mark tasks as completed
✅ Delete tasks
✅ Input validation for smooth experience
✅ Clean and simple menu-driven interface

🧠 How It Works

The app uses a Python list to store tasks in memory.
Each task is saved as a small dictionary, for example:

{"task": "Complete Python project", "done": False}


You can easily add tasks, mark them as done, or delete them.
All actions are handled via an interactive text-based menu.
